# Baby C Compiler

This is a project that was built in my compiler class. The compiler that I built was written in the C language and converts a subset of the C language, Baby C, to an intermediary assembly language known as ILOC. It works by taking input from a file, then uses a software called FLEX to scan the file. After this I generate an LR(1) grammar which combined with another software called YACC creates an abstract synctax tree (AST). Based off of this AST, I use depth first search and recursion to create ILOC. I keep track of variable names and assignments by using a lookup table. Due to the nature of this assignment, I used a linked list for the lookup table because of it was simple to implement. However, the lookup table would have been more efficient if I used a hash table instead.
